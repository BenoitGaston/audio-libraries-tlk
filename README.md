# audio-libraries-tlk

A set of Python tools to explore and modify data contained in a music library such as playlists or album cover artwork. 

## Acknoledgments

This project is heavily relying on the one hand on Scholnicks' [itunesLibrary](https://pypi.org/project/iTunesLibrary/) (it self a port of Drew Stephen's [Mac-iTunes-Library](https://github.com/dinomite/Mac-iTunes-Library)) and on the other hand on KristoforMaynard's [music-tag](https://pypi.org/project/music-tag/)

## Usecases

This project has been orginited from the needs of:

1. Transfering playlists from different audio devices.
2. Convert cover artwork of songs to non-prog images.
3. Explore inconsistencies in a music library (incomplete albums, songs placed in the wrong location, ...)

## How to install

python3 -m pip install audio-libraries-tlk
```
